We also need to join the player data in the form of ELO ratings and tournament participation data onto this set data too so the model has a better idea of each player's respective skill level."

Including participation rates in higher level tournaments was thought to mediate this issue. \n",

    "* \"**Tier 1 Tournaments**, sometimes called premier tournaments or super-majors, offer high prize pools and feature the best players from all over the world.\"\n",
